**Last Updated**: August 22, 2025

## üéØ Phased Approach - Small, Focused Iterations

**Goal**: Improve TypeScript types without breaking any existing APIs

- [x] **Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation to all types**
  - Added detailed documentation to all type definitions
  - Included parameter descriptions and usage examples
  - Added @internal tags for internal-only types

- [x] **Replace 'any' types with more specific unions where possible**

  - Used generic types and proper union types

- [x] **Add generic types to FilterScheme**

**Success Criteria Met**:

- ‚úÖ All existing tests pass unchanged
- ‚úÖ Better TypeScript IntelliSense
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes

### Phase 3: Error Handling ‚úÖ (COMPLETED 2025-08-22)

**Goal**: Add better error handling and validation

- [x] **Create custom error classes** (2025-08-22)
  - [x] FilterError base class
  - [x] SchemaValidationError for invalid schemas
  - [x] OperatorError for operator issues
  - [x] Meaningful error messages with context

- [x] **Improve error handling in existing code** (2025-08-22)
  - [x] Better error messages for invalid field paths
  - [x] Graceful handling of missing properties
  - [x] Validate operator parameters at runtime

**Success Criteria Met**:

- ‚úÖ Better error messages for developers
- ‚úÖ Graceful failure modes (invalid field paths, missing properties, invalid operators)
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing APIs
- ‚úÖ All tests pass

### Phase 4: Code Organization (Non-Breaking)

**Goal**: Split the large Filterer class without changing APIs

- [x] **Extract operator functions** (2025-08-22)
  - [x] Move comparison operators to separate file (`src/operators.ts`)
  - [x] Move unary operators to separate file (`src/operators.ts`)
  - [x] Create operator registry in Filterer
  - [x] Keep the main Filterer class API unchanged

- [x] **Extract utilities** (2025-08-22)
  - [x] Move value extraction logic to separate utility (`src/utils.ts`)
  - [x] Update Filterer to use utility for value extraction
  - [x] Maintain backward compatibility

**Success Criteria (complete):**

- Operator logic is modular and maintainable
- Utility logic is separated and reusable
- No file exceeds 200 lines
- All existing APIs work unchanged
- All tests pass

### Phase 5: New Features (Breaking Changes OK)

**Goal**: Add new operators and capabilities

- [x] **Add missing operators** (2025-08-22)
  - [x] `notEqual` operator (2025-08-22)
  - [x] `between` operator for ranges (2025-08-22)
  - [x] `in` operator for array membership (2025-08-22)
  - [x] `regex` operator for pattern matching (2025-08-22)

- [x] **Performance optimizations** (2025-08-22)
  - [x] Add memoization for repeated filter operations (2025-08-22)
  - [x] Optimize nested field extraction (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Add benchmarking tests

**Success Criteria**:

- New operators work correctly
- Performance improvements measurable
- Breaking changes clearly documented

### Phase 6: Documentation & Polish

**Goal**: Complete documentation and examples

- [ ] **API Documentation** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Complete JSDoc comments
  - [ ] Generate TypeDoc documentation
  - [ ] Create usage examples
  - [ ] Update README with new features

- [ ] **Migration Guide** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Document any breaking changes
  - [ ] Provide migration examples
  - [ ] Version compatibility matrix

**Success Criteria**:

- Complete API documentation
- Clear migration path
- Ready for major version release
  - [ ] Add minification for production builds
  - [ ] Update package.json exports

## üìù Notes

**Phased Approach Strategy:**

- **Small iterations**: Each phase focuses on one specific improvement
- **Non-breaking first**: Phases 1-4 maintain full backward compatibility
- **Testing throughout**: Every phase validates that existing functionality works
- **Clear success criteria**: Each phase has measurable outcomes
- **Breaking changes last**: Only Phase 5 introduces potential breaking changes

**Why This Approach:**

- **Lower risk**: Smaller changes are easier to review and test
- **Easier to debug**: If something breaks, we know exactly what caused it
- **Better for learning**: Each phase teaches us more about the codebase
- **Flexible**: We can stop, adjust, or reorder phases based on what we learn

## üìù Notes

- **Breaking Changes**: Phase 1 tasks will introduce breaking changes and require a major version bump
- **TypeScript**: All new code must be strictly typed with no `any` types
- **Testing**: Each new feature must include comprehensive tests
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must have JSDoc comments
- **Performance**: Consider performance impact of all changes
