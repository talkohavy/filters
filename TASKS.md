# Tasks: @talkohavy/filters

**Last Updated**: August 22, 2025

## üéØ Phased Approach - Small, Focused Iterations

### Phase 1: Basic Type Safety (Non-Breaking)

**Goal**: Improve TypeScript types without changing any APIs

- [ ] **Improve type definitions** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Replace `any` types with proper generics in type definitions
  - [ ] Add strict operator type unions
  - [ ] Create better interfaces for filter conditions
  - [ ] Add JSDoc comments for better IntelliSense
  - [ ] Keep all existing APIs unchanged

**Success Criteria**:

- All existing tests pass unchanged
- Better TypeScript IntelliSense
- No breaking changes

### Phase 2: Test Infrastructure (Non-Breaking)

**Goal**: Modernize and expand the test suite

- [ ] **Convert tests to TypeScript** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Rename .js test files to .ts
  - [ ] Fix TypeScript imports and types
  - [ ] Ensure all existing tests still pass

- [ ] **Expand test coverage** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
  - [ ] Test all comparison operators individually
  - [ ] Add tests for nested field paths
  - [ ] Test complex AND/OR combinations

**Success Criteria**:

- All tests run with TypeScript
- > 90% code coverage
- No breaking changes

### Phase 3: Error Handling (Non-Breaking)

**Goal**: Add better error handling and validation

- [ ] **Create custom error classes** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] FilterError base class
  - [ ] SchemaValidationError for invalid schemas
  - [ ] OperatorError for operator issues
  - [ ] Meaningful error messages with context

- [ ] **Improve error handling in existing code** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Better error messages for invalid field paths
  - [ ] Graceful handling of missing properties
  - [ ] Validate operator parameters at runtime

**Success Criteria**:

- Better error messages for developers
- Graceful failure modes
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

### Phase 4: Code Organization (Non-Breaking)

**Goal**: Split the large Filterer class without changing APIs

- [ ] **Extract operator functions** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Move comparison operators to separate file
  - [ ] Move unary operators to separate file
  - [ ] Create operator registry
  - [ ] Keep the main Filterer class API unchanged

- [ ] **Extract utilities** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Move value extraction logic to separate utility
  - [ ] Create helper functions for common operations
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

**Success Criteria**:

- Cleaner, more maintainable code structure
- No file exceeds 200 lines
- All existing APIs work unchanged

### Phase 5: New Features (Breaking Changes OK)

**Goal**: Add new operators and capabilities

- [ ] **Add missing operators** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] `notEqual` operator
  - [ ] `between` operator for ranges
  - [ ] `in` operator for array membership
  - [ ] `regex` operator for pattern matching

- [ ] **Performance optimizations** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Add memoization for repeated operations
  - [ ] Optimize nested field extraction
  - [ ] Add benchmarking tests

**Success Criteria**:

- New operators work correctly
- Performance improvements measurable
- Breaking changes clearly documented

### Phase 6: Documentation & Polish

**Goal**: Complete documentation and examples

- [ ] **API Documentation** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Complete JSDoc comments
  - [ ] Generate TypeDoc documentation
  - [ ] Create usage examples
  - [ ] Update README with new features

- [ ] **Migration Guide** (2025-08-22)
  - [ ] Document any breaking changes
  - [ ] Provide migration examples
  - [ ] Version compatibility matrix

**Success Criteria**:

- Complete API documentation
- Clear migration path
- Ready for major version release
  - [ ] Add minification for production builds
  - [ ] Update package.json exports

## üìù Notes

**Phased Approach Strategy:**

- **Small iterations**: Each phase focuses on one specific improvement
- **Non-breaking first**: Phases 1-4 maintain full backward compatibility
- **Testing throughout**: Every phase validates that existing functionality works
- **Clear success criteria**: Each phase has measurable outcomes
- **Breaking changes last**: Only Phase 5 introduces potential breaking changes

**Why This Approach:**

- **Lower risk**: Smaller changes are easier to review and test
- **Easier to debug**: If something breaks, we know exactly what caused it
- **Better for learning**: Each phase teaches us more about the codebase
- **Flexible**: We can stop, adjust, or reorder phases based on what we learn
